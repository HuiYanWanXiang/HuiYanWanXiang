Concept Breakdown:
- Introduce the Pythagorean Theorem (勾股定理).
- Visualize a right triangle and the relationship between its sides.
- Highlight the equation: a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse.
- Provide a real-world application or example.

Scene Steps:
1. Scene Introduction (0.0 - 1.0 seconds):
   - Fade in from black to a title text: "勾股定理 (Pythagorean Theorem)".
   - Use a simple, bold font for clarity.

2. Draw Right Triangle (1.0 - 4.0 seconds):
   - Draw a right triangle labeled with sides a, b, and hypotenuse c.
   - Use bright colors for the triangle and labels for visibility.
   - Position the triangle in the center of the screen.

3. Highlight Sides (4.0 - 6.0 seconds):
   - Animate a highlight effect on side a and side b, indicating they are the legs of the triangle.
   - Display text: "直角三角形的两条直角边" (the two legs of the right triangle).

4. Introduce Hypotenuse (6.0 - 8.0 seconds):
   - Animate a highlight effect on side c, indicating it is the hypotenuse.
   - Display text: "斜边" (the hypotenuse).

5. Present the Equation (8.0 - 10.0 seconds):
   - Fade in the equation: "a² + b² = c²" below the triangle.
   - Use a dynamic effect to draw the equation, emphasizing each term one by one.

6. Real-World Application (10.0 - 11.5 seconds):
   - Show a simple visual example, such as a ladder leaning against a wall, illustrating the theorem in use.
   - Add text: "应用示例: 计算斜边长度" (Application example: Calculate the length of the hypotenuse).

7. Scene Conclusion (11.5 - 12.0 seconds):
   - Fade out the triangle and equation while displaying the text: "勾股定理的美妙!" (The beauty of the Pythagorean Theorem!).
   - Fade to black.

Key Objects:
- Right triangle with labeled sides (a, b, c).
- Text labels in Mandarin.
- Equation "a² + b² = c²".
- Visual example (ladder against a wall).

Equations:
- a² + b² = c²

Timing Notes:
- Ensure smooth transitions between scenes.
- Maintain a consistent pace to fit the 12.0 seconds target duration.
