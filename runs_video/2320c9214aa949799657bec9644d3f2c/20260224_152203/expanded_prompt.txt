Animation Plan for "勾股定理 (Pythagorean Theorem)"

Concept Breakdown:
- Introduce the Pythagorean Theorem: a² + b² = c²
- Visualize a right triangle with sides a, b, and hypotenuse c.
- Demonstrate the relationship between the areas of squares constructed on each side.

Scene Steps:
1. **Scene Introduction (0.0 - 1.5 seconds)**
   - Fade in the title "勾股定理" at the center of the screen.
   - Background music starts softly.

2. **Draw the Right Triangle (1.5 - 3.0 seconds)**
   - Animate the drawing of a right triangle labeled with vertices A, B, and C.
   - Label the sides: AB = a, BC = b, and AC = c.
   - Use a light color for the triangle to enhance visibility.

3. **Construct Squares on Each Side (3.0 - 6.0 seconds)**
   - Animate the construction of a square on side a (AB) with area a².
   - Follow with a square on side b (BC) with area b².
   - Lastly, animate a square on the hypotenuse (AC) with area c².
   - Use distinct colors for each square for clarity.

4. **Show Area Relationships (6.0 - 9.0 seconds)**
   - Overlay the equation a² + b² = c² on the screen as the squares are displayed.
   - Highlight the areas of the squares as they are mentioned in the equation.
   - Consider using arrows or animations to indicate that the combined area of squares on sides a and b equals the area of the square on side c.

5. **Conclusion (9.0 - 12.0 seconds)**
   - Fade out the squares and triangle, leaving only the equation a² + b² = c² in bold.
   - Add a voiceover or text that reinforces the theorem: "在直角三角形中，两个直角边的平方和等于斜边的平方."
   - Fade out the title and background music concludes.

Key Objects:
- Right triangle (labeled with sides a, b, c)
- Squares on each side (with labels a², b², c²)
- Text overlays for the theorem and voiceover

Equations:
- a² + b² = c²

Timing Notes:
- Ensure smooth transitions between scenes.
- Maintain a steady pace to ensure clarity, especially when explaining the areas of the squares.
- Allow enough time for viewers to absorb the information before moving to the next step.
