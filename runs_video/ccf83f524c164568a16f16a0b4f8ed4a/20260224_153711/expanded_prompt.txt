Animation Plan for Pythagorean Theorem

**Concept Breakdown:**
- Introduce the Pythagorean Theorem, stating that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b).
- Visualize the theorem using a right triangle, highlighting each side and the respective squares.

**Scene Steps:**
1. **Scene Introduction (0.0 - 2.0 seconds):**
   - Fade in the title "Pythagorean Theorem" at the center of the screen.
   - Use a soothing background music track to set the tone.

2. **Triangle Creation (2.0 - 4.0 seconds):**
   - Draw a right triangle with vertices labeled A, B, and C, where C is the right angle.
   - Animate the triangle's sides being drawn sequentially, highlighting side lengths a, b, and hypotenuse c.

3. **Squares on Each Side (4.0 - 8.0 seconds):**
   - Animate squares being constructed on each side of the triangle:
     - Square on side a: Animate it growing from side a.
     - Square on side b: Animate it growing from side b.
     - Square on side c: Animate it growing from side c.
   - Use different colors for each square to distinguish them (e.g., red for a², blue for b², green for c²).

4. **Equation Display (8.0 - 10.0 seconds):**
   - Fade in the equation "a² + b² = c²" below the triangle.
   - Highlight each term in the equation one by one, emphasizing their relation to the respective squares.

5. **Conclusion (10.0 - 12.0 seconds):**
   - Briefly summarize the theorem with a text box stating "In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides."
   - Fade out the triangle and equation while keeping the summary text visible for a moment before fading out.

**Key Objects:**
- Right triangle (labeled A, B, C)
- Squares on each side (a², b², c²)
- Text boxes for the theorem and equation

**Equations:**
- a² + b² = c²

**Timing Notes:**
- Ensure smooth transitions between scenes with a slight pause after significant animations (like the squares).
- Maintain a consistent pace to fit the 12-second target without rushing the visuals or text.
