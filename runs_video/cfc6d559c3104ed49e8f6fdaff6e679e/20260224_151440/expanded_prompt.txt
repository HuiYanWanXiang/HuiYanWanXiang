Animation Plan for Pythagorean Theorem Explanation

Concept Breakdown:
- Introduce the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²
- Visualize a right triangle with sides a, b, and hypotenuse c.
- Demonstrate the relationship between the areas of the squares on each side.

Scene Steps:
1. **Scene Introduction (0.0 - 1.0 seconds)**
   - Display the title "Pythagorean Theorem" on the screen with a smooth fade-in effect.
   - Use a simple background to keep the focus on the triangle.

2. **Right Triangle Creation (1.0 - 3.0 seconds)**
   - Draw a right triangle with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
   - Label the sides: AB = a, BC = b, and AC = c.
   - Add a brief text description: "In a right triangle..."

3. **Area Visualization (3.0 - 7.0 seconds)**
   - Animate squares being drawn on each side of the triangle:
     - Square on side a (AB): label area as a².
     - Square on side b (BC): label area as b².
     - Square on side c (AC): label area as c².
   - Use a contrasting color for each square to enhance visibility.
   - Briefly display the equation a² + b² = c² beneath the triangle.

4. **Area Comparison (7.0 - 10.0 seconds)**
   - Animate the areas of squares a² and b² merging into square c².
   - Highlight the transition with a glowing effect to show that the areas are equal.
   - Add a text annotation: "The sum of the areas of the squares on the legs equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse."

5. **Conclusion (10.0 - 12.0 seconds)**
   - Fade out the triangle and squares.
   - Display the final equation a² + b² = c² prominently on the screen.
   - End with a voiceover or text saying, "This is the Pythagorean theorem!"

Key Objects:
- Right triangle (labeled)
- Squares on each side (animated)
- Text annotations for clarity
- Background that complements the visuals

Equations:
- a² + b² = c²

Timing Notes:
- Ensure smooth transitions between scenes.
- Allocate time for viewers to absorb each visual before moving to the next step.
- Maintain a steady pace to fit within the 12-second target while ensuring clarity.
